 * to stop ignoring them.<br> This feature does not apply to earlier revisions
 * for which it is necessary to run a Select File (DF) command to determine the
 * invalidation status. In this case, the rejection or acceptance of invalidated
 * cards will have to be handled by the application.
 *
 * <p>Note 2: the APDU commands resulting from the invocation of the "prepare"
 * methods shall be compliant with the PRIME revision 3 cards.
 *
 * <p>For all "prepare" type commands, unless otherwise specified, here are the
 * ranges of values checked for the various parameters:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>SFI: [0..30] (0 indicates the current EF)
